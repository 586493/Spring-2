				<strong>Laboratory 7</strong><br>
				<strong>Advanced services deployment</strong>
				<p>
					During laboratories students should get familiar with detailed concepts of deploying
					the web application to the servers based on containerization approach with load balancers.
				</p>
				<p>The following tasks must be completed:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						(1 point) You should use the Spring Boot project from Lab 6 as API Layer.
						Moreover you should create new Spring Boot application (GUI) with Upload Form (View)
						for uploading the files and additional View to present the list of uploaded files.
						New application (GUI) should send all received information to the API layer
						(app created during Lab 6) in order to perform business logic.
					</li>
					<li>
						(1 point) All Spring Boot projects should be packaged into the JAR file
						and the process of deployment for each of it should be described using
						dedicated Dockerfile (place it in different folder).
					</li>
					<li>
						(2 point) In this laboratory you will extend your composition by additional
						proxy layer - Load Balancers. First Load Balancer will offer GUI functionality
						for the external users and the second Load Balancer will offer API functionality
						only for the GUI apps. You should create two additional Dockerfile
						(with configuration for HA Proxy or NGinx) in order to offer needed functionality.
						In your composition your should concern usage of at least two GUI containers
						and two API containers.
					</li>
					<li>
						(2 points) Finally please create the final services composition using
						the docker-compose.yml file. Final version of the composition should offer
						all functionality presented in the Fig. 1. GUI containers and API containers
						should be launched in two separated networks: public network (for GUI apps)
						and private network (for API apps and DB server). API apps should store uploaded
						files in the special volume folder - similar to the laboratory 6.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Attention: Final solution should be submitted in the zip format with correct folder
					structure, docker-compose.yml, required Dockerfiles, empty upload dir, JAR file with GUI application
					and JAR file with API, all elements placed in right directory.
